        p-adic numbers

The p-adic numbers were first introduced by Hensel, who was motivated by exploring an analogy between the ring of integers, Z, and the ring C[X] of polynomials with complex coefficients. As we'll see, the p-adic numbers are an incredibly useful way to encode divisibility information in elements that have a rich structure, both algebraic and analytic, to them; this allows for depth at the intersection of several pillars of mathematics. Algebraically, we know that the integers and polynomials over C both form rings, and in fact have a decomposibility structure to them - elements of each, i.e. integers and polynomials, can be factored multiplicatively into irreducibles. In the integers, these irreducibles are the primes, and in C[X] they are the monic linear polynomials of the form X - a; in either case, the "primes" are the building blocks of the whole ring.

One way to encode information about the relationship an element to the primes that compose it is the express the element additively in terms of the prime. We can write an integer n in terms of a prime p by expressing it in "base p":
    n = \sum_{k = 0}^n a_k p^k, 0 \leq a_k \leq p - 1 \in Z
This expression allows for the efficient extraction of divisibility information about n in terms of p; we can quickly see "how divisible" it is by p (i.e. how many times we can divide p out, or equivalently, the largest power of p that divides n), what its residues modulo p are, etc. Similarly, we can express a polynomial P(X) in terms of the irreducible X - a as
    P(X) = \sum_{k = 0}^n a_k (X - a)^k, a_k \in C
(One way to do this is with Taylor's theorem). In this form, we easily see whether P(x) is divisible by X - a, and accordingly whether a is a root of P, and if so, what its multiplicity is. Because integers are composed of primes and polynomials are composed of irreducibles in the same way, divisiblity by primes and the roots of a polynomial are integral to the essence of the integer and polynomial, respectively; both serve to "ground" on axis of description along which the element resides, and with enough, we can fully reconstruct the original element in whatever form we wish, while simultaneously laying bare the relationship the element has in its constitution to the ring as a whole. Hensel hoped that the exploration of the above metaphor would allow for the study of power series methods in number theory; after decades of more research, it's now clear that the influence of the p-adic numbers goes well beyond this. The expansions above are ways of expressing elements that provide local information about them.

With polynomials, we can try to extend the above expansions to the field of fractions as well - for a rational function over C, we can consider its Laurent series:
    f(X) = \sum_{k = n_0}^\infty a_k (X - a)^k, a_k \in C, n_0 \in Z
This provides a field extension for C[X] into its field of fractions, with the alternate view of the extension C((X - a)) as the ring of formal Laurent series, in an attempt to preserve the expansion above towards the end of maintaining the visibility of the local information afforded by the expansion. We can try to do the same with integers, and consider the rational numbers expressed through finite-tailed "Laurent series":
    x = \frac{a}{b} = \sum_{k = n_0}^{n_1} a_k p^k, a, b, n_0 \in Z, n_1 \in N

This is the p-adic expansion of x. This is a critical juncture in the construction. We've managed to build up the analogy between complex polynomials and integers, extending to the fractions of each ring, leading us to the familiar base p expressions of rational numbers, but motivated by the preservation of local - at the prime p - information through the appropriate, p-centric expansions. Consider for a moment what an alluring and elegant path of procession here might be. One may notice that the extension - really, the completion - of the rational numbers into the real numbers has a natural connection to our construction thus far. With respect to the topology induced by the standard absolute value on the rationals - our measure for size - the base p expansions of rational numbers makes clear the fact that the rationals are peppered with holes it can't possibly fill. This is a consequence of the finite-tailed nature of the "Laurent expansions" we constructed: in terms of the standard absolute value, we can successively throw in more and more negative powers of p to obtain increasingly fine-grained rational numbers, but the restriction to a finite tail means we can never complete the process. Further, by alternating which coefficients of the series we use, we can partition any interval with more and more granularity, up to arbitrary fineness and precision, but restricted from ever reaching the limit of this process - a true continuum. Stuck as we are with the arbitrarily but not infinitely fine topology of the rationals, and with the progression of rationals towards each other, closer and closer, but without anything to finally plug the gap, we can escape the situation by considering what would happen if we relax the finite-tail restriction in one direction. We're left with non-terminating, potentially non-repeating, base p expansions of numbers, which of course are the real numbers, the solution we seek to plug the gaps. And why shouldn't this be possible? After all, with respect to the standard absolute value we use for measuring distance and size, the formal series expansion of rational numbers certainly converges even if we lets n_0 by infinite.

What if we go the other direction, and allow the other tail to be infinite? Does this plug holes in the same way, and can we still meaningfully consider notions of convergence? That is, suppose we extend the rationals by extending the base p expansions not by including increasingly small powers of the base, p, into the series representation, but rather by defining a suitable arithmetic that enabled us to extend the power series indefinitely in the left direction, i.e. by considering larger and larger powers of p.

Let's recap where we are - motivated by studying algebraic analogies between the ring of complex polynomials and the ring of integers, we arrived at "Laurent series" for integers, which coincicdes with the familiar base p representation of rational numbers. Such a representation has both important analytic and number theoretic subtlties. First and foremost, it allows for the import of power series methods into the study of the integers, satisfying our initial curiosity; in doing so, it embodies a local-global information, shedding insight on the multiplicative structure of the integer only by considering its expansion at a local prime. But further, there's a foreshadowing of significant analytic properties as well, because by identifying the field of rational numbers with base p expansions, it becomes immediately obvious that the tails of the corresponding poewr series completely determine the size of a rational number (the more large powers of p there are, the bigger the number is), and we can discuss whether two rational numbers are close together by looking at the first power of p where they differ, which provides a tight asymptotic bound on the order of magnitude of the difference. Furthermore, it is this interpretation of the standard absolute value (and its induced distance metric) that makes obvious the incompleteness of the rationals - the fact that they are riddled with holes follows directly from the finite-tailed nature of the base p expansions, since we can keep adding more and more terms, specifying rationals with finer and finer precision, without ever reaching anything. This lends itself to a completion of the rationals, which lands us at the reals. By considering the complementary question of extending a rational number's expansion in the other direction, we are imposing an elegant conceptual dichotomy on both the algebraic and analytic structure of the rationals and their extensions. Further, if we follow the same chains of reasoning above, we'll see that the induced absolute value (and distance metric) on the p-adic numbers is a perfect counterpart to the standard absolute value - whereas the size of a real number is equivalent to the largest power of p that divides them (this is the order of magnitude), the size of a p-adic number is equivalent to opposite the largest power of p that divides it.

Before continuing, let's lay down some definitions. Notice below that we allow p to be any integer, not necessarily prime, none of the above intuition technically requires p to be a prime.

    (Def) p-adic integer: Let p be an integer. A p-adic integer is a formal series of the form
        alpha = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty a_k p^k

We denote the set of p-adic integers with Z_p. A prominent reason why the p-adic numbers have such significance in number theory is that if we truncate the p-adic integer alpha at the n-th term,
   alpha_n := \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} a_k p^k
we immediately project back into Z/p^nZ, the integers modulo p^n. This is critical to how we formally define the p-adic numbers, but also hints at the congruence information that's encoded in p-adic numbers. We can chain together each of the projection mappings of larger truncates of a p-adic integer into the integers modulo powers of p below, and consider the resulting limiting process to culminate in "the integers modulo p^\infty". This procedure is known as an inverse limit, and essentially takes a set of rings, in this case Z/p^nZ for every natural number n, requires the diagram consisting of every ring and their projection maps to all the rings prior to them commute; sequences of elements from Z/p^nZ are the elements of the inverse limit which are consistent with all the projection maps are what compose the inverse limit.
